# **Customer Churn Analysis**
This project analyzes customer churn â€” why customers stop using a company's products or services.
Using a customer dataset, it transforms variables, groups tenure, and explores key factors influencing churn.

### Key Goals:
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing correlations and churn patterns based on tenure, gender, senior citizen status, and monthly charges using ggplot2 and corrplot.
**Model Building:** Implementing linear regression and decision trees to predict churn. Metrics like mean squared error, confusion matrices, and ROC curves assess model performance.
**ANOVA:** Analyzing variance to explore the impact of attributes like tenure group, contract type, and paperless billing on monthly charges.
**Hypothesis Testing:** Applying t-tests, chi-square tests, and F-tests to evaluate if factors like contract type or monthly charges significantly influence churn.
